          We’ve trained a model called <strong>Legal Navi</strong> that
          interacts in a conversational way. It can answer legal questions,
          guide users in filing FIRs, summarize BNS laws, and ensure legal
          document completeness. Legal Navi has been built using real-world
          legal data and deep NLP models for accurate, friendly responses.

          <h2>How We Trained the Model</h2>
          <p>
            Legal Navi uses transformer-based models like BERT and
            legal-specific datasets, including FIR archives, Indian Penal Code
            data, and judgment corpora. It is fine-tuned to understand legal
            jargon, sections, and context, making it suitable for legal research
            assistance.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Legal Navi?</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike general chatbots, Legal Navi is trained exclusively on Indian
            legal data and includes a special FIR checker, BNS query resolver,
            and real-time legal guidance. This makes it ideal for both students
            and citizens who need basic legal clarity.
          </p>

          <h2>What's Next?</h2>
          <p>
            Our team is working on extending Legal Navi to support document
            upload, live voice response, and integration with court data
            portals. Your feedback is valuable — use Legal Navi and tell us what
            features matter most!
